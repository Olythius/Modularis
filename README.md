# Modularis — *Mod your bot. No code. Just chat.*

**Modularis** is an AI-powered Discord bot that empowers anyone to create, customize, and run new bot commands — all through natural language, no coding required. Just describe what you want in chat, and Modularis instantly generates, loads, and activates the command for you.

- **Powered by DeepSeek:** Real, runnable JavaScript code is generated and sandboxed for immediate use.
- **Instant feedback:** Test new commands live in Discord and see results instantly.
